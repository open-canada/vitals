<!-- Cases reported since the start of the vaccination campaign*, as of December 18, 2021 -->
*"[As of December 18, 2021] Since the start of the vaccination campaign on December 14, 2020, PHAC received case-level vaccine history data for 78.0% (n=1,214,966) of COVID-19 cases aged 12 years or older. [...] Compared to unvaccinated cases, fully vaccinated cases were 79% less likely to be hospitalized and 71% less likely to die as a result of their illness"*

<!-- Of these cases: -->

<!-- - 727,925 (76.8%) were unvaccinated at the time of their episode date -->
<!-- - 43,471 (4.6%) were not yet protected by the vaccine, as their episode date occurred less than 14 days after their first dose -->
<!-- - 53,171 (5.6%) were only partially vaccinated, as their episode date occurred either 14 days or more after their first dose or less than 14 days after their second dose -->
<!-- - 122,843 (13.0%) were fully vaccinated, as their episode date occurred 14 days or more after their second dose -->
