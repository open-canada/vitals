<!-- #subtitle: "Open Source Tool for Visualizing Open Data" -->

#### Description

The Open Canada Vital Statistics Tracker App is  designed so as to allow one to efficiently track and analyze data from the  Canadian Vital Statistics - Death  (CVSD) database, specifically in relationship to COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination.
Using the App, one can in  interactive manner (using the menu and various options), visualize and compare vital (deaths) statistics by province and by causes of death.
When enabled in menu, the App also allows one to correlate and visually compare death statistics with the rate of vaccination in each province. Dashed line shows "at least one dose" vaccinated, solid line shows "fully vaccinated".
Use the pull-down menus on the left to select 
the data of interest from the source Open Canada portal. Use a variety of [App Tools] to analyze the selected data.

<!-- the date range, province(s), and death cause(s) of particular interest.  -->

By default, the App uses cached CVSD data for faster operation. To read data directly from the Statistics Canada CVSD portal, please check "Use Live" option in the menu. Please note however that this works only if the portal is up and running, which you can check by clicking [here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310081001).


For more information on how to use the App, please see [App Tools].


#### Dislaimer

The Open Canada Vital Statistics Tracker App is developed by the [R4GC Community](https://open-canada.github.io/r4gc/index.html#r4gc-community) as part of weekly [Lunch and Learn "Data Science with R"](https://open-canada.github.io/r4gc/index.html#lunch-and-learn-data-science-with-r-meetups) training. It is not to be associated with any Government of Canada  program or department.

### App Tools




The following visualization tools are provided in this App.  

#### Time-series tools

<!-- - [Overview]: shows multi-dimensional plot  which you can save or copy by right-clicking on the image  -->
- Overview shows multi-dimensional (with facets) plot  which you can save or copy by right-clicking on the image. 

<!-- - Interactive plot: allows interactive visualization and analysis -->
- [By cause] and [By province] analysis: is an interactive time-series plot that allows one to zoom on the data along the timeline and see the values behind the data by hovering over the curves.

- [By cause (alt.)] and [By province (alt.)] analysis: is another type an interactive visualization of data by cause and by province. See below how to use it.

#### Statistics tools



- [Tables]  allow  one to view, filter, subset, and export the various statistical data as an .csv, pdf, Excel file, or to a printer or clipboard. This includes:   

  - Summary Table, which shows Totals, Weekly average (Mean), Standard Deviation (SD), and  regression slope (Weekly dynamics),
  - Correlations Table, which shows correlation coefficients between the selected deaths causes and time
  - Raw death and vaccination (when selected) data for the selected causes and regions. 

- [Correlations] allows one to compute  and  visualize correlations between selected death causes and/or vaccination and time, using different correlation methods.

<!-- - [Summary]: is an interactive table that provides a statistical summary of the selected data such as: lowest / highest / average weekly results and  weekly average dynamics (i.e. how much result change weekly over time) computed as a slope of the linear model regression line. Positive "dynamics" means that values grow with time, "0" dynamics means that data are stable and  negative "dynamics" means the deaths numbers decline with time. -->
<!-- ...is an another interactive table that shows  raw data extracted from the source Open Canada portal using the selected criteria.  -->



<!-- Table below shows  data extracted using the selection criteria chosen in the menu.  -->


##### How to use menues:

- Use SHIFT + mouse click to add/remove item from the selection menu
- Alternatively, use DEL button to delete the item from the menu list
- Note that some images may become illegible if two many items are selected in the menus.

##### How to use interactive plots:

- Select/deselect any line by clicking on line description on right (Double-click  reverts the selection).
- Zoom on any section by drugging mouse of the region of interest in the  plot (Double-click on the plot restores original plot).
- Hover over a line to see data details.
- For more options, use the buttons in the upper right corner of the plot image. You can move, change, reset and save plot image using the buttons there.
- Dashed lines show the vaccination rate, when this option is selected in menu.


##### How to use interactive tables:

- Move / reorganize columns by drugging column names.  Change the number of rows to be shown using "Show entries" pull-down menu
- Filter by typing in the  boxes under the column names. Sort by clicking on the column name.
- Export table or its selection in one of  available formats using the buttons provided.




##### Other notes:

- Some provinces have population less then a million, therefore the *per capita* data (per million) for these provinces should be treated as an scaled up to a million  to allow *per capita* comparison with other provinces.

-  In "By cause" and "By province" analysis, the plots show the data only for the first selected item in menu (for the  region and  death cause shown on top of the selected items)

<!-- - NB: It can take long to display large quantities of data. -->



- Finally, please note that when  data are loaded or processed (which can take some time depending on the size of the selected data), the error messages may appear on the screen. Simply ignore them, or use this time to read  [Additional information] or browse the [Source Code](https://github.com/open-canada/vitals).

Quoting from offcial site,
<!-- [(CVSD)](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3233]:   -->
"This [CVSD database] is an administrative survey that collects  demographic and medical (cause of death) information annually and monthly from all provincial and territorial vital statistics registries on all deaths in Canada.
The data are used to calculate basic indicators (such as counts and rates) on deaths of residents of Canada. Information from this database is also used in the calculation of statistics, such as cause-specific death rates and life expectancy."

In general, the monthly updated CVSD surveys are updated the first Monday on the month and show the lag of about two and half months (e.g., the data released in the December provide statistics for up to end of September). 
The data from each province are combined into the national CVSD database automatically and  independently from each other, which is why the differences in the last reported days and in the dynamics of various statistics metrics are observed.

The following subsets of the  CVSD database are used in this App.

##### Notes (Source: [Statistics Canada - Table: 13-10-0810-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310081001) )

Footnote 1    
Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics - Death database (CVSD).

Footnote 2    
Death refers to the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after a live birth has taken place. Stillbirths are excluded.
<!-- (Refer to) -->

Footnote 3   
During the production of each month's death statistics, data from previous months/years may be revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the provincial and territorial vital statistics offices.

Footnote 4   
Data for the reference years 2020 and 2021 are provisional due to the shortened duration of data collection.

Footnote 5  
2017 to 2021 data for Yukon are not available.

Footnote 6    
Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. Fewer deaths were captured by the time of the release. As a result, these death counts have been adjusted to account for the undercoverage in the data. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 data are preliminary.

Footnote 7   
These are provisional death counts and may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or counts from provincial or territorial health departments and other agencies. There are additional delays in receiving the data from the provincial and territorial vital statistics offices. Differences will also occur when different definitions and collection periods are used.  

Footnote 8    
Statistics Canada’s capacity to provide useful and timely information is dependent on its ability to receive the information from the provinces and territories. For several jurisdictions this information is typically sent within 30 days of the death event, while for others it is sent 30 to 60 days, or more, following the death event. For this reason, data for certain provinces and territories for certain weeks are suppressed.

Footnote 9     
These are provisional counts and subject to change. Care should be taken when making conclusions from provisional data as these counts will not include all deaths that occurred during this period, especially the most recent periods. Futhermore, deaths investigated by coroners or medical examiners, such as suicides, accidents and homicides, often require lengthy investigations. Consequently, information on the causes of death, particularly among people younger than 45, whose deaths are more likely to result in an investigation, typically requires more time before it is reported to Statistics Canada. These counts will be revised as more records are received and processed.

Footnote 10     
Weeks are as defined in several epidemiological studies, including those of the United States Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC weeks start on a Sunday and end on a Saturday. They are numbered sequentially from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the year. The first CDC week in a year ends on the first Saturday of January, provided it has at least four days in that calendar year. The first CDC week of a year may include a few days from the previous calendar year. Conversely, the first few days of a calendar year may be included in the last CDC week of the previous year. Since CDC weeks can overlap two months, they do not perfectly recreate calendar months or years.

Footnote 11     
This real-time cube is designed to track changes in the death counts since their initial release. Typically, data are released as preliminary for a specific period, revised the following period based on new information and eventually revised in an annual or historical revision process.


Footnote 12     
Deaths for which the date of death are missing are excluded.


Footnote 13     
The counts in this table have been rounded to a neighbouring multiple of 5 to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act.

Footnote 14   
The cause of death tabulated is the underlying cause of death. This is defined as (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause is selected from the conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death.

Footnote 15     
World Health Organization (WHO), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10).

Footnote 16   
The causes of death list included in this table is based on the 10 leading causes of death in 2018 and COVID-19 deaths. The list for leading causes of death is based on the list that was developed and that is being used by the National Center for Health Statistics of the United States in their annual report on leading causes of death.


Footnote 17    
"Other causes of death" is a residual to other deaths listed in this table. "Information unavailable" is a category which includes deaths for which the medical certificate of cause of death (for Provinces and Territories sending death certificates to Statistics Canada for coding) or the underlying cause of death code (for Provinces coding causes of death) has not yet been received at Statistics Canada.

Footnote 18    
Starting with the 2013 reference year, a new automated coding system was used to select the underlying cause of death. In 2017, an updated version of this coding system was implemented. For more information or to obtain documentation regarding the impact of these changes, please contact Statistics Canada's Statistical Information Service (toll-free 1-800-263-1136; 514-283-8300; STATCAN.infostats-infostats.STATCAN@Canada.ca).

Footnote 19      
The total, all causes of death and the number of deaths for which information on the causes of death is unavailable are based on the estimates presented in table 13-10-0792-01.

*"For cases from December 14, 2020 up until November 27, 2021, fully vaccinated cases were 68% less likely to die as a result of their illness, compared to unvaccinated cases (Table 3).*  
**Note:** 
Using this App, one can find that in the considered period (December 14, 2020 -- November 27, 2021) over 75% (10100 / 13075) of all deaths occurred prior to May 1, 2021, when the  majority of population (over 97%)  was unvaccinated. Recomputing these numbers for the period *after May 1* (when the proportion of vaccinatated was approximately equal to the proportion of  unvaccinated) results in the  conclusion that between May and November fully vaccinated cases were *more likely* to die as a result of COVID-19, compared to unvaccinated cases.

"The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001)." 

Absolute difference = 185 cases - 11 cases per 15,210, yielding a difference of 174 cases / 15,210. 
This is 1.1% absolute difference of cases between the vaccinated and unvaccinated . 
This is a 1.1% effectiveness rate which they reported as 94.1% relative effectiveness rate.
 
2. Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine, C4591001 Clinical Trial Group,  N Engl J Med 2020; 383:2603-2615, 
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577 

RESULTS
"A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6).


Absolute difference = 162 cases - 8 cases per 21,720 yielding a difference of 154 cases / 21,720.
This is 0.7% absolute difference of cases between the vaccinated and unvaccinated . 
That is vaccine shows 0.7% effectiveness rate which is  reported as 95% relative effectiveness rate.

**Note: 
The above references expose the lack of evidence and scientific integrity in the reports produced by the vaccine manufecturers. 
   The final document was released by Pfizer under the court order on 17 November  2021. It  provides data that was collected, but not disclosed prior to 17 November 2021,  by the vaccine manufacture on  real world adverse events that occurred in the first 2.5 months after Emergency Use Authorization.  It lists: over 1,200 deaths; over 25,000 nervous system adverse events; and Anaphylaxis and Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (listed under “Safety concerns”) **
