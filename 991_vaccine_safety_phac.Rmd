- 'Reported side effects following COVID-19 vaccination in Canada', 
Canadian COVID-19 vaccination safety report, Public Health Agency of Canada,

"Up to and including *December 31, 2021*, a total of 258 reports with an outcome of death were reported following vaccination. Although these deaths occurred after being vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, they are not necessarily related to the vaccine. "

Based on the medical case review using the WHO-UMC causality assessment categories, it has been determined that:

- 123 reports of deaths could not be assessed due to insufficient information
  - Among the 123 that could not be assessed, 1 was in a report of TTS (Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty)
- 93 reports of deaths are unlikely linked to a COVID-19 vaccine
- 42 reports of death are still under investigation
  - Among the 42 still under investigation, 6 were in reports of TTS (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD)

*"Vaccine efficacy is generally reported as a relative risk reduction (RRR). It uses the relative risk (RR)—ie, the ratio of attack rates with and without a vaccine—which is expressed as 1–RR. Ranking by reported efficacy gives relative risk reductions of 95% for the Pfizer–BioNTech, 94% for the Moderna–NIH, 91% for the Gamaleya, 67% for the J&J, and 67% for the AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccines. However, RRR should be seen against the background risk of being infected and becoming ill with COVID-19, which varies between populations and over time. Although the RRR considers only participants who could benefit from the vaccine, the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine, considers the whole population. ARRs tend to be ignored because they give a much less impressive effect size than RRRs: 1.3% for the AstraZeneca–Oxford, 1.2% for the Moderna–NIH, 1.2% for the J&J, 0.93% for the Gamaleya, and 0.84% for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines."*
