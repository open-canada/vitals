#### Report side-effect

<!-- , which is a bit tricky, if you don't know what to write in some manadary form fields.  But when you know, it takes 10 mins to do it. -->

Any Canadian can report vaccine side-effect, as a consumer, i.e., without a doctor.
Heath Canada encourages everyone impacted by the vaccine to do so. They also provide
guidance on how to fill out online form. This is how you do it:

-   See if your symptoms are reported in the USA COVID Vaccine Adverse Event Reports
    (VAERS): [vaers.hhs.gov](https://openvaers.com)
-   Check if your vaccine batch (a.k.a. lot), which is printed on is among the ["bad ones"](https://www.howbad.info), according to VAERS 
-   Go to the Health Canada Voluntary Side Effect reporting electronic form:
    <https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary>.
-   See an example of submitted form
    [here](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf).
    There are three places there you need to know how to fill out: in Section B: Patient
    ID write your initials; in Section D: Product DIN and Product Name - paste the
    vaccine names (and batch/lot number, if available), as printed on your receipt).
-   Call Heath Canada Voluntary Reporting support line: Tel. 866-234-2345, if you still
    have problems submitting the form, leave a message, they should respond within 24
    hours.

#### Learn to distinguish propaganda from true journalism

If the opposing views are not presented, if media shows only one kind of rally posters
(aimed at discrediting the rally) and does not show others (that represent the true
purpose of the rally), if it talks only about the number of cases and doses, but does
not say anything about deaths and side-effects (even though this data is also publicly
available), than it is most likely propaganda.

#### Join the democratic rallies across the country in support of restoring human rights and truth, related to COVID and vaccines

- Many rallies are happening all over the country. Check them out! 
See for yourself who they are: "extremists" or concerned Canadian citizen, many with children, many who have been denied access to playgrounds, universities, sports, travel, work

    
    <!-- Join them - to experience yourself "The Wind of Change". -->
