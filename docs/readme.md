#### Report side-effect

<!-- , which is a bit tricky, if you don't know what to write in some manadary form fields.  But when you know, it takes 10 mins to do it. -->

Any Canadian can report vaccine side-effect, as a consumer, i.e., without a doctor.
Heath Canada encourages everyone impacted to do so. They also provide
guidance over the phone on how to fill out online form. This is how you do it:

-   See if your symptoms are reported in the US COVID Vaccine Adverse Event Reports
    (VAERS): [vaers.hhs.gov](https://openvaers.com)
-   Check if your vaccine batch (lot), which is printed on your vaccination receipt, is among the ["bad ones"](https://www.howbad.info), according to VAERS 
-   Go to the Health Canada Voluntary Side Effect Reporting portal to submit electronic form:
    <https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary>
-   To see how to fill out the form, see a real example of the submmitted form
    [here](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf). ---
    There are three places there you need to know how to fill out: in Section B: Patient
    ID write your initials; in Section D: Product DIN and Product Name - paste the
    vaccine names (and batch/lot number, if available), as printed on your receipt.
-   Call Heath Canada Voluntary Reporting support line: Tel. 866-234-2345, if you still
    have problems submitting the form, leave a message, they should respond within 24
    hours.

#### Learn to distinguish propaganda from true journalism

If the opposing views are not presented, <br>
if media shows only one kind of rally posters
(aimed at discrediting the rally) and does not show others (that represent the true
purpose of the rally), <br>
if it talks only about the number of cases and doses, but does
not provide perspective inn to thw deaths and side-effects, than it is could propaganda.


#### Join  democratic rallies across the country in support of restoring human rights and truth, related to COVID and vaccines

- Many rallies are happening all over the country. Check them out. <br>
See for yourself who are these people: "extremists"  or concerned Canadian citizen, many with children, many who have been denied access to playgrounds, universities, sports, travel, work...
