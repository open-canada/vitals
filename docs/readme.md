## Open Canada Vital Statistics Application Resources

### Learn facts:

- ‘Reported side effects following COVID-19 vaccination in Canada’, Canadian COVID-19 vaccination safety report, Public Health Agency of Canada, <https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccine-safety/> (Compare the number of deaths and severe health damages already reported to that from COVID. Note the contunuing increase of reports)
- ‘Cases following vaccination’, COVID-19 Daily Epidemiology Update, Public Health Agency of Canada, <https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html (Recalculate numbers for period after April, when mass vaccination of entire population started)
- Open Canada Vital Statistics Tracker: [https://open-canada.github.io/Apps/vitals](https://open-canada.github.io/Apps/vital) (Note reduction of all non-COVID deaths since pandemic and the jump in the number of unexplained deaths after April)

<!-- 
You can use this App to compute statistics from raw  data, such as:
   - percentage of fully vaccinated,since  vaccination was officiall launched on December 14, 2020: eg. you 
   - total number of COVID deaths in any province for any time interval: eg. you can compute how many COVID deaths before May, when vaccination rate was less than 3%,and after May 2021
   - dynamics (regression slope) for each reported cause of death: eg. you can see that slope for _all_  death causes has become negative since the new COVID death category was introduced in 2020, meaning that was many of those causes are not report as "COVID deaths")

<!-- ### Personal Declarations -->

- _"A Personal Declaration Of Opposition To The Abuse of Our Charter of Rights and Freedoms By The State"_ by Hon. Brian Peckford (the last living First Minister who helped craft the Constitution Act 1982 and The Charter of Rights and Freedoms that forms part of it): [pdf (with links)](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/brian-peckford-declaration.pdf), [html (with comments)](https://peckford42.wordpress.com/2022/01/02/a-personal-declaration-of-opposition-to-the-abuse-of-our-charter-of-rights-and-freedoms-by-the-state/)

### Take Action: 

#### Sign a petition

Petition to Protect the fundamental civil rights of Canadians by disallowing vaccine passport certificates nationally: <https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-3592>

#### Report side-effect

Any Canadian can Report Vaccine Side-effect, as a consumer, i.e., without a doctor.  Heath Canada encourages everyone impacted by the vaccine to do so. They also  provide guidance on how to fill out the only form, which is a bit tricky, if you don't know what to write in some manadary form fields.  But when you know, it takes 10 mins to do it. This is how you do it:
- See if you sympthoms are reported in the USA COVID Vaccine Adverse Event Reports (VAERS): https://openvaers.com
- Go to <https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary>. 
- See an example of submitted side-effort reporting form  [here](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf). There are three places there you need to know how to fill out (In Section B: Patient ID - write your initials; In Section D: Product DIN and Product Name - paste the vaccine names as printed on your reciept)
- Call Heath Canada Voluntary Reporting support line: Tel. 866-234-2345, if you still have problems submitting the form, leave a message,  they normally respond within the same day.


#### Learn to distinguish propaganda from true  journalism

If the opposing views are not presented, if media shows only one kind of rally posters  (aimed at discrediting the rally), and does not show  others (that represent the true purpose of the rally), if it talks only about the number of cases and  doses, but does not say anything about deaths and side-effects (even though this data is also publicly available), than it is most likely propaganda.

#### Join the democraatic rallies accross the country in support of restorinng human rights and truth, related to COVID and vaccines

Many rallies are happening all over  the country. The biggest one is happening now in Ottawa (#ConvoyForFreedom). Join it - to experience yourself "The Wind of Change".
