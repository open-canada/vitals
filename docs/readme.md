#### CONCLUSION: Open Canada data that has become available since the start of COVID-19 vaccination in Canada <u>do not</u> support the original vaccine manufacturers\' claims about  vaccine efficacy and safety.
 

Additional data:
 
 
[usg1] **Natural immunity vs. vaccine-induced immunity** (Source: [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm) - [Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK83QqbNOmU)):


- Both Vaccine-induced and  Natural immunity considirably  reduce the risk of hospitalization  
- Natural immunity  provides about twice  better protection  than  vaccine-induced immunity
- Natural immunity is slightly reduced  after vaccination

[ukg1] **COVID deaths vs. COVID alone deaths** (Source: [gov.uk](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/deathsfromcovid19withnootherunderlyingcauses) - [Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHvwWWcjYw)):

- Of all reported in UK COVID deaths, only 13.6%  are due to COVID alone. 
- 78% of all COVID alone deaths occurred in people with 65+ of age.
- Average age of death from COVID is 82.5 years, which is statistically equal to the average life expectancy in UK.

## What you can do:

#### Report side-effect

<!-- , which is a bit tricky, if you don't know what to write in some manadary form fields.  But when you know, it takes 10 mins to do it. -->

Any Canadian can report vaccine side-effect, as a consumer, i.e., without a doctor, at the 
Heath Canada portal. This is how you do it:

-   See if your symptoms are reported in the US COVID Vaccine Adverse Event Reports
    (VAERS): [vaers.hhs.gov](https://openvaers.com)
-   Check if your vaccine batch (aka lot), which is printed on your vaccination receipt, is among the ["bad ones"](https://www.howbad.info), according to VAERS data. 
-   Go to the Health Canada Voluntary Side Effect Reporting portal :
    <https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary>
-   Submit electronic form there as shown in this 
    [Example](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf). (
    There are three places there you need to know how to fill out: in Section B: Patient
    ID write your initials; in Section D: Product DIN and Product Name - paste the
    vaccine names (and batch/lot number, if available), as printed on your receipt. 0
-   Call Heath Canada Voluntary Reporting support line: Tel. 866-234-2345, if you still
    have problems submitting the form, leave a message, they should respond within 24
    hours. )
    
<!--     
#### Sign petitions

-   Petition to Protect the fundamental civil rights of Canadians by disallowing vaccine
    passport certificates nationally:
    <https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-3592>
-   Proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Canada Unity (CU) and the Senate
    of Canada and the Governor General of Canada: <https://canada-unity.com/mou/>

<!--
#### Learn to distinguish propaganda from true journalism

If the opposing views are not presented, <br>
if media shows only one kind of rally posters
(aimed at discrediting the rally) and does not show others (that represent the true
purpose of the rally), <br>
if it talks only about the number of cases and doses, but does
not provide perspective inn to thw deaths and side-effects, than it is could propaganda.


#### Join  democratic rallies across the country in support of restoring human rights and truth, related to COVID and vaccines

- Many rallies are happening all over the country. Check them out. <br>
See for yourself who are these people: "extremists"  or concerned Canadian citizen, many with children, many who have been denied access to playgrounds, universities, sports, travel, work...
