 Numbers below are *quoted* from **official** government sources, unless marked by (\*), in which case they are *computed* from
**official** government sources using the [App](https://open-canada.github.io/Apps/vitals).
<!-- Data for up to October 2021 are used to allow comparison between adverse reactions
statistics and deaths statistics, the latter being reported with several months delay. -->

[usg1] **Natural immunity vs. vaccine-induced immunity** (Source: [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm) - [Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK83QqbNOmU)):


- Both Vaccine-induced and  Natural immunity considirably  reduce the risk of hospitalization  
- Natural immunity  provides about twice  better protection  than  vaccine-induced immunity
- Natural immunity is slightly reduced  after vaccination

[ukg1] **COVID deaths vs. COVID alone deaths** (Source: [gov.uk](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/deathsfromcovid19withnootherunderlyingcauses) - [Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHvwWWcjYw)):

- Of all reported in UK COVID deaths, only 13.6%  are due to COVID alone. 
- 78% of all COVID alone deaths occurred in people with 65+ of age.
- Average age of death from COVID is 82.5 years, which is statistically equal to the average life expectancy in UK.

#### CONCLUSION: Open Canada data that has become available since the start of COVID-19 vaccination <u>do not</u> support the original vaccine manufacturers\' claims about  vaccine efficacy and safety.
 
 
 <!-- 
#### CONCLUSION:   The statistics that was made available to the Government of Canada since the start of the general public vaccination <u>do not</u> support the original vaccine manufacturers\' claims about  vaccine efficacy and safety. Based on the analyzed data, it appears that COVID-19 vaccines provide less efficient and less safe protection against COVID-19 compared to Natural immunity. Comments and corrections from experts of all related fields are sought for.

In  meanwhile, based on the mounting evidence on the lack of evidence in vaccines safety and efficahe recommendation is made to continue monitoring  closely the listed above Open Canada statistics to-->

## What you can do:

#### Sign petitions

-   Petition to Protect the fundamental civil rights of Canadians by disallowing vaccine
    passport certificates nationally:
    <https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-3592>
-   Proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Canada Unity (CU) and the Senate
    of Canada and the Governor General of Canada: <https://canada-unity.com/mou/>

#### Report side-effect

<!-- , which is a bit tricky, if you don't know what to write in some manadary form fields.  But when you know, it takes 10 mins to do it. -->

Any Canadian can report vaccine side-effect, as a consumer, i.e., without a doctor, at the 
Heath Canada portal. This is how you do it:

-   See if your symptoms are arelady reported in the US COVID Vaccine Adverse Event Reports
    (VAERS): [vaers.hhs.gov](https://openvaers.com)
-   Check if your vaccine batch (aka lot), which is printed on your vaccination receipt, is among the ["bad ones"](https://www.howbad.info), according to VAERS data. 
-   Go to the Health Canada Voluntary Side Effect Reporting portal :
    <https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary>
-   Submit electronic form there as shown in this 
    [Example](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf). (
    There are three places there you need to know how to fill out: in Section B: Patient
    ID write your initials; in Section D: Product DIN and Product Name - paste the
    vaccine names (and batch/lot number, if available), as printed on your receipt. 0
-   Call Heath Canada Voluntary Reporting support line: Tel. 866-234-2345, if you still
    have problems submitting the form, leave a message, they should respond within 24
    hours.

#### Learn to distinguish propaganda from true journalism

If the opposing views are not presented, <br>
if media shows only one kind of rally posters
(aimed at discrediting the rally) and does not show others (that represent the true
purpose of the rally), <br>
if it talks only about the number of cases and doses, but does
not provide perspective inn to thw deaths and side-effects, than it is could propaganda.


#### Join  democratic rallies across the country in support of restoring human rights and truth, related to COVID and vaccines

- Many rallies are happening all over the country. Check them out. <br>
See for yourself who are these people: "extremists"  or concerned Canadian citizen, many with children, many who have been denied access to playgrounds, universities, sports, travel, work...
