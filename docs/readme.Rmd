### Talking about "The Elephant in the Room". 
<!-- How to defend the constitutional freedom and scientific integgity in the times of crisis-->

<!-- by a Senior Government of Canada Data Scientist, Dr. Dmitry Gorodnichy, the lead and moderator of the [R4GC Data Science community](https://open-canada.github.io/r4gc/index.html#r4gc-community)  group, -
, which started on January 29, 2021 and which continues till present,

<!--   , all bound by the [Code of Conduct](conduct_code_conduite_eng.pdf) which instructs employees to refrain from making  criticisms of  the Government
of Canada, 
We refrain from making public criticisms of the CBSA and/or the Government
of Canada including posting critical comments on social media fora. -->

The following presentation was given to the Government of Canada employees, who expressed interest in learning about the  latest Government of Canada data related to COVID-19 vaccination. 
A considerable portion of this presentation was about how to create a safe and respectful environment within Government of Canada where Government of Canada employees can discuss this topic ("The Elephant in the Room"), which is already causing much of polarization within Canadian public, including among the Government of Canada employees, and which has  led to  the largest in the Canadian history demonstrations of protests  of Canadians against the government.
government, demanding it to revoke its "Mandatory Vaccination Policies" <!-- as being scientifically, ethically,  legally, and economically unjustified. -->
The solution to  this problem  was seen in keeping the discussion focused entirely on  Canada's own sources and open data, much of which -- thanks to the [Open Goverment and Scientific Integrity](https://open-canada.github.io/r4gc/open-policies.html#open-policies) policies introduced by the  Liberal Government several years ago -- have now become available, including  statistics of the number of deaths by cause and by vaccination status, which can be analyzed  and effectively visualized using contemporary  open source data science tools such as [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cansim/index.html) and [RStudio](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).  
<!-- Another part of the presenation -->

<!-- A[open-canada.github.io/vitals](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals)  lot of effort in this presentation was given to applaud many of the Government of Canada efforts -->

- COVID Deaths for people younger than 65 with no health problems: < 0.01% Cases

Data from other governments:
 
 
[ukg1] **COVID deaths vs. COVID alone deaths** (Source: [gov.uk](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/deathsfromcovid19withnootherunderlyingcauses) - [Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHvwWWcjYw)):

- Of all reported in UK COVID deaths, only 13.6%  are due to COVID alone. 
- 78% of all COVID alone deaths occurred in people with 65+ of age.
- Average age of death from COVID is 82.5 years, which is statistically equal to the average life expectancy in UK.

 
[usg1] **Natural immunity vs. vaccine-induced immunity** (Source: [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm) - [Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK83QqbNOmU)):


- COVID vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization considerably (by x10-x20)
- However, natural immunity  reduces the risk of hospitalization even more (by x20-x50),  while the chance of having severe complication from COVID infection for people younger than 65 and in good health is very low (<0.01% Cases based on [ukg1])  and for  children under 12 even lower (<0.0001% Cases based on [ukg2]).

Any Canadian can report vaccine side-effect, as a consumer, i.e., without a doctor, at the 
Heath Canada portal. This is how you do it:

-   Check if your symptoms are reported in the US COVID Vaccine Adverse Event Reports
    (VAERS): [vaers.hhs.gov](https://openvaers.com). 
-   Go to the Health Canada Voluntary Side Effect Reporting portal :
    <https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary>
-   Submit electronic form there as shown in this 
    [Example](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf). (
    There are three places there you need to know how to fill out: in Section B: Patient
    ID write your initials; in Section D: Product DIN and Product Name - paste the
    vaccine names (and batch/lot number, if available), as printed on your receipt. )
-   Call Heath Canada Voluntary Reporting support line: Tel. 866-234-2345, if you still
    have problems submitting the form, leave a message, they should respond within 24
    hours. )
