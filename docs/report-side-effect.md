# Reporting COVID-19 vaccines side effects

#### Background

Reporting of serious (or life threatening) side effects of vaccines is mandatory in Canada. 
However, reporting of non-serious (or not life threatening) side effects  in Canada is voluntary.
Many doctors may not have time to do it, nor they provide guidance to their patients on how they can do it. 

For this reason many non-serious side effects remain unreported.  Many doctors will not do it, 
and consumers do not know how to do it. 
In fact, many Canadians may not even know that they can do report vaccine side-effect themselves, i.e.  without a medical doctor.
There are no instructions on the Health Canada portal on how to do it. 
The link to the [Health Canada Voluntary Side Effect Reporting portal](https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary) may also be 
rather difficult to find.

This page is created to address this gap and to help Canadians to report any vaccine (or any drug) side-effect, as a consumer.
Health Canada encourages everyone to do so.  -- It is  thanks to such efforts  that vaccines (and drugs) can be improved for the benefits of all.

Once you know how to do it, it should not take more than fifteen minutes to do it. This is how you do it. 
An [Example](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf) is provided here. 

#### Submitting Voluntary Side Effect Report via Health Canada portal


Step 1: Go to the Health Canada Voluntary Side Effect Reporting portal :
    <https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/side-effects-reporting-form.php?form=voluntary>

Step 2: Submit electronic form there as shown in this 
    [Example](https://open-canada.github.io/vitals/SideEffectReporting-example-1.pdf).   
    
- There are three places there that you need to know how to fill out:  <br> - in Section B: Patient     ID write your initials; <br> - in Section D: Product DIN and Product Name - paste the     vaccine names (and batch/lot number, if available), as printed on your receipt. 
    
- Make sure you provide a valid email address, which will be used to send you to further instructions on how ontinue side-effect report process.
    
- If you still  have problems submitting the form (i.e., clicking on button "SUBMIT" does not lead you anywhere),  
call Heath Canada Voluntary Reporting support line: Tel. 866-234-2345, if you leave a message.  They should respond within 24
    hours. If they did not, please call again.

Step 3:  A few (2-5) days later you should receive email from *Canada Vigilance (HC/SC) <canadavigilance@hc-sc.gc.ca>* 
(with  Subject: "Correspondence from the Marketed Health Products Directorate - Adverse Reaction Number 0009xxxxx), which will provide you with the  
Adverse Reaction Report (AER) number and which will ask you to submit additional details though their portal.

If you don't receive email from them within 5 business days, please check you Spam folder and, 
if it is not there, please call them at Tel. 866-234-2345 and leave a message. 

As they note in their email: *"Posting of reports in the online database remains 3 months behind the date of reporting. 
This delay accounts for the necessary activities involved in report processing"* 


#### Additional resources:


The following additional resources are provided to help you prepare your side-effect report. 
There you can check if your symptoms  are already reported in national adverse event reporting systems, and if so, how common they are, for which type of vaccine, and which vaccine batch (a.k.a. lot, which is the number printed on your vaccination receipt)
