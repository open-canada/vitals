#### Description

The Open Canada Vital Statistics Tracker App is  designed so as to allow one to efficiently track and analyze   Canadian Vital Statistics - Death database (CVSD) data, specifically in relationship to COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination.

Using the App, one can  efficiently , in  interactive manner using the menu, visualize and compare vital (deaths) statistics by province and by causes of death.
Use the pull-down menus to select the date range, province(s), and death cause(s) of particular interest. 

When enabled in menu, the App also allows one to correlate and visually compare death statistics with the rate of vaccination in each province. Dashed line shows "at least one dose" vaccinated, solid line shows "fully vaccinated".

The following visualization tools are provided:  

- Multi-dimensional plot: suitable  for printing
- Interactive plot: allows interactive visualization and analysis
- Interactive time-series: allows to zoom along the timeline
- Interactive table: allows filtering, subsetting and exporting the  data as an .csv file

By default, the App uses cached CVSD data for faster operation. To read data directly from the Statistics Canada CVSD portal, please check "Use Live" option in the menu. Please note however that this works only if the portal is up and running, which you can check by clicking [here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310081001).

#### Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics - Death database (CVSD)


The CVSD database contains demographic and medical (cause of death) information annually and monthly from all provincial and territorial vital statistics registries on all deaths in Canada.
Information from this database is also used in the calculation of statistics, such as cause-specific death rates and life expectancy.

In general, the CVSD database is updated weekly and lags about three months (e.g., the data released in the end of December provide statistics for up to end of September). 
The data are gathered from each province  independently from each other, which is why the differences in the last reported days and in various statistics metrics are observed, and then  automatically  combined into the national CVSD database.  
The following subsets of the  CVSD database are used in this App.

##### Notes (Source: [Statistics Canada - Table: 13-10-0810-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310081001) )

Footnote 1    
Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics - Death database (CVSD).

Footnote 2    
Death refers to the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after a live birth has taken place. Stillbirths are excluded.
<!-- (Refer to) -->

Footnote 3   
During the production of each month's death statistics, data from previous months/years may be revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the provincial and territorial vital statistics offices.

Footnote 4   
Data for the reference years 2020 and 2021 are provisional due to the shortened duration of data collection.

Footnote 5  
2017 to 2021 data for Yukon are not available.

Footnote 6    
Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. Fewer deaths were captured by the time of the release. As a result, these death counts have been adjusted to account for the undercoverage in the data. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 data are preliminary.

Footnote 7   
These are provisional death counts and may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or counts from provincial or territorial health departments and other agencies. There are additional delays in receiving the data from the provincial and territorial vital statistics offices. Differences will also occur when different definitions and collection periods are used.  

Footnote 8    
Statistics Canadaâ€™s capacity to provide useful and timely information is dependent on its ability to receive the information from the provinces and territories. For several jurisdictions this information is typically sent within 30 days of the death event, while for others it is sent 30 to 60 days, or more, following the death event. For this reason, data for certain provinces and territories for certain weeks are suppressed.

Footnote 9     
These are provisional counts and subject to change. Care should be taken when making conclusions from provisional data as these counts will not include all deaths that occurred during this period, especially the most recent periods. Futhermore, deaths investigated by coroners or medical examiners, such as suicides, accidents and homicides, often require lengthy investigations. Consequently, information on the causes of death, particularly among people younger than 45, whose deaths are more likely to result in an investigation, typically requires more time before it is reported to Statistics Canada. These counts will be revised as more records are received and processed.

Footnote 10     
Weeks are as defined in several epidemiological studies, including those of the United States Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC weeks start on a Sunday and end on a Saturday. They are numbered sequentially from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the year. The first CDC week in a year ends on the first Saturday of January, provided it has at least four days in that calendar year. The first CDC week of a year may include a few days from the previous calendar year. Conversely, the first few days of a calendar year may be included in the last CDC week of the previous year. Since CDC weeks can overlap two months, they do not perfectly recreate calendar months or years.

Footnote 11     
This real-time cube is designed to track changes in the death counts since their initial release. Typically, data are released as preliminary for a specific period, revised the following period based on new information and eventually revised in an annual or historical revision process.


Footnote 12     
Deaths for which the date of death are missing are excluded.


Footnote 13     
The counts in this table have been rounded to a neighbouring multiple of 5 to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act.

Footnote 14   
The cause of death tabulated is the underlying cause of death. This is defined as (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause is selected from the conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death.

Footnote 15     
World Health Organization (WHO), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10).

Footnote 16   
The causes of death list included in this table is based on the 10 leading causes of death in 2018 and COVID-19 deaths. The list for leading causes of death is based on the list that was developed and that is being used by the National Center for Health Statistics of the United States in their annual report on leading causes of death.


Footnote 17    
"Other causes of death" is a residual to other deaths listed in this table. "Information unavailable" is a category which includes deaths for which the medical certificate of cause of death (for Provinces and Territories sending death certificates to Statistics Canada for coding) or the underlying cause of death code (for Provinces coding causes of death) has not yet been received at Statistics Canada.

Footnote 18    
Starting with the 2013 reference year, a new automated coding system was used to select the underlying cause of death. In 2017, an updated version of this coding system was implemented. For more information or to obtain documentation regarding the impact of these changes, please contact Statistics Canada's Statistical Information Service (toll-free 1-800-263-1136; 514-283-8300; STATCAN.infostats-infostats.STATCAN@Canada.ca).

Footnote 19      
The total, all causes of death and the number of deaths for which information on the causes of death is unavailable are based on the estimates presented in table 13-10-0792-01.

Perez, M.D., Gonzalo PÃ©rez Marc, M.D., Edson D. Moreira, M.D., Cristiano Zerbini, M.D., Ruth Bailey, B.Sc., Kena A. Swanson, Ph.D., et al., for the C4591001 Clinical Trial Group*
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577


RESULTS
The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). 


Absolute difference = 185 cases - 11 cases per 15,210, yielding a difference of 174 cases / 15,210. 
This is 1.1% absolute difference of cases between the vaccinated and unvaccinated . 
This is a 1.1% effectiveness rate which they reported as 94.1% relative effectiveness rate.


EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS
The primary end point was the efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in preventing a first occurrence of symptomatic Covid-19 with onset at least 14â€¯days after the second injection in the per-protocol population, among participants who were seronegative at baseline. End points were judged by an independent adjudication committee that was unaware of group assignment. Covid-19 cases were defined as occurring in participants who had at least two of the following symptoms: fever (temperature â‰¥38Â°C), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, or new olfactory or taste disorder, or as occurring in those who had at least one respiratory sign or symptom (including cough, shortness of breath, or clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia) *and* at least one nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if the participant was hospitalized) that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptaseâ€“polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test. 

NB: The  definition of COVID-19 used is in this study is different from that used in WHO (which is evidence of infection)

#2
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577


RESULTS
A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6).


Absolute difference = 162 cases - 8 cases per 21,720 yielding a difference of 154 cases / 21,720.
This is 0.7% absolute difference of cases between the vaccinated and unvaccinated . 
This is a 0.7% effectiveness rate which they reported as 95% relative effectiveness rate.

NB: Additional note: the presented result is wrt to the COVID-19 definition used by paper authors (which uses conjuction of two conditions: symptoms and pcr test), not wrt to COVID-19 definition used by WHO

"In several cases Ventavia lacked enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed symptomatic covid-19 was the trialâ€™s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-19.)"
